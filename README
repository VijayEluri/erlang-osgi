INSTALL:
1) Unpack a current Apache Felix distribution to 
2) Add bundles for Event Admin and Config Admin to the bundle directory
3) Use bnd to create a bundle from the jinterface jar included with Erlang, and add the resulting jar to the bundle directory
4) It is not used yet, but you might as well add the current Jackson distribution to the bundle directory (it is already a valid bundle)
5) Compile couchext-osgi (the 'byt' directory must exist)
 > javac -cp ../felix/bin/felix.jar:../felix/bundle/org.apache.felix.eventadmin-1.2.2.jar:../felix/bundle/OtpErlang.jar -d byt src/couch/*.java
6) jar it up
 > jar cfm couchext.jar src/couch/manifest.mf -C byt core
7) deploy that to the felix bundle directory as well
 > mv couchext.jar ../felix/bundle/
8) cd to the felix directory and start the framework
 > java -jar bin/felix.jar
9) type 'felix:lb' to make sure the necessary bundles are installed and activated

USAGE:
1) Open a new terminal and cd to the couchext-osgi/lib directory
2) Ensure the escript 'couchlib' uses your local erlang cookie and has the necessary permissions
3) Run the escript and enter some text, you should see the response from the osgi node
4) Configure couchdb to treat couchlib as an external process handler (details on the couchdb wiki)
5) When you open the configured URL in a browser, you should see the JSON request from couch echo to the screen 
6) Make some useful bundles
